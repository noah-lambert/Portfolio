                        <p class="projectDescription">Android based application that was designed and created by a team of three students (myself included) using bi-weekly agile meetings to discuss the state of the project and goals for the upcoming week.
                            Our goal was to create an app that can help students and faculty alike to find lecutre halls, dorm building, and other locati<span id="plattsmap-dots">...</span><span id="plattsmap-more">ons on campus quickly and easily.  
                            In addition to that we also included a feature for users to store their weekly schedule and have their next class appear as a reminder on the app's home screen.  
                            I was responsible for a lot of the front-end work along with working on the map, map features, and retrieving directions from the Google Maps API.  
                            Using Android and XML framework along with a Firebase backend, we were able to bring this idea into reality.</span>

                        <p class="projectDescription">A text-based quarantine project that was inspired by the hit movie "The Hangover".  
                            Using simple Java class structure I was able to create a clean and enjoyable game that is sure to captivate the compulsive gambler in all of us.  
                            Stay tuned as future I intend to integrate this concept into a more visual game for both Android and iOS mobile plattforms.</p>

                        <p class="projectDescription">Web-based application targeted towards SUNY Plattsburgh students that provides them a means to search and discover different clubs/groups that are a part of the college. 
                            This project was created and brought to life by a team of students who belong to Coding Hub, a club at SUNY Plattsburgh where students split into teams to build web-based applic<span id="club-hub-dots">...</span><span id="club-hub-more">ations that would be benificial to the school or some other group. 
                            I was a front-end developer on this project and was mainly responsible for the creation of the navigation bar and other home page components.  
                            Our team used weekly agile meetings to communicate our progress and plan for the next step in the projects lifecycle.
                            This project was built using Node.js and Firebase.</span>
